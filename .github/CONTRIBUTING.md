## How to contribute to AluBot ❤

### Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Aluerie/AluBot/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, 
[open a new one](https://github.com/Aluerie/AluBot/issues/new). 
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

### Did you write a code that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, 
or testability of AluBot will generally not be accepted.

#### Do you intend to add/request a new feature or change an existing one?

* If you are only intending to do so - either open a new GitHub Issue or 
write me on discord using contacts in the end of this page. Again, be sure to include all relevant information.

* If you already have a code implementation of your idea - open a new GitHub pull request. 
Once again, do not forget to include all relevant information.

#### Do you have questions about the source code?

* Ask me any question about AluBot in the discord - contact me using info below.
