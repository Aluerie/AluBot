## How to contribute to AluBot ❤

### Do you want to contribute, but you do not have initial ideas what to code/help with

* Check out [Project](https://github.com/users/Aluerie/projects/8/views/1) to get some ideas what I want to work on 
and what I am currently working on. 
* Currently, the bot is really just a one-person project so I'm apologizing in advance if this todo list^ are messy 
because I do not really expect any random help from random visitors.

### Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under 
[Issues](https://github.com/Aluerie/AluBot/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, 
[open a new one](https://github.com/Aluerie/AluBot/issues/new). 
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

### Did you write a code that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, 
or testability of AluBot will generally not be accepted.

### Do you intend to add/request a new feature or change an existing one?

* If you are only intending to do so - either open a new GitHub Issue or GitHub discussion under "Ideas" category. 
You can also write me on discord using contacts in the end of this page. 
Again, be sure to include all relevant information.

* If you already have a code implementation of your idea - open a new GitHub pull request. 
Once again, do not forget to include all relevant information.

### Do you have questions about the source code?

* Ask me any question about AluBot - contact me using info below. 
If you do not feel like contacting me directly or want the question to be public then you can create new discussion in
[this repository discussions](https://github.com/Aluerie/AluBot/discussions) 
under "Q&A" category.
