Initial idea was to send me notifications  when my favourite  Dota 2/ League of Legends 
[twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/) streamers pick my favourite heroes/champions.

However, the whole process grew into making *the ultimate multipurpose bot*
with pretty much everything I ever needed ! Check List of features after the pic.

### üõ†Ô∏èRunning

I would probably prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot. You can invite the bot to your server with link above,
discord native interface or `$invite` command.
And I'm honestly not a very good programmer. Nevertheless, 
1. Python `3.10` or higher is required.
2. Set up venv `python3.10 -m venv venv`.
3. Install dependencies `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`.
4. Rename `config.example.py` into `config.py` and fill out all needed config parameters.
   * notable one is you will need to PostgreSQL 9.5 or higher to fill out `POSTGRES_URL`.
5. Replace discord ID variables in `cogs/utils/var.py` with your own values.
6. Create SQL tables using `sql/tables.sql` definitions with console or run `py main.py db create`.
7. Run the bot with `py main.py`.
   * if you want to run test version of the bot then you need to create `tlist.py` file with 
   following template below and run the bot with an extra flag `py main.py --test` 
   
```python
"""
List of extensions from `./cogs` to test. The bot will load only extensions from that list. 

-- List them without `.py`-ending as in 'confessions' and not 'confessions.py'

Actual AluBot does not use this file at all, the bot just assumes the `test_list` empty
"""
test_list = [  # for test bot
    'embedmaker',  # just some cogs to test 
    'fun', 
    'error',  # global error handlers from there are handy
    'meta',  # it has /$help, /$setup, so you can look how your new commands looks here
]
```
### ü§óThanks 
Thanks to everybody who has ever helped me with the bot in any way or form. 

Special thanks to the whole `discord.py` community for endless amount of educational value.
