Initial idea was to send me notifications  when my favourite  Dota 2/ League of Legends 
[twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/) streamers pick my favourite heroes/champions.

However, the whole process grew into making *the ultimate multipurpose bot*
with pretty much everything I ever needed ! Check List of features after the pic.

### Reporting Bugs and Making Suggestions

* There are [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Aluerie/AluBot/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* TL;DR^: Feel free to open a GitHub Issue/PR/Discussion or write me (Aluerie ‚ù§#6524) on discord. You can 
look my [Project](https://github.com/users/Aluerie/projects/8/views/1) for ideas.

### Running

I would probably prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot. You can invite the bot to your server with link above,
discord native interface or `$invite` command.
And I'm honestly not a very good programmer. Nevertheless, 
1. Python `3.10` or higher is required
2. Set up venv `python3.10 -m venv venv`
3. Install dependencies `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`
4. Rename `config.example.py` into `config.py` and fill out all needed config parameters
   * notable one is you will need to PostgreSQL 9.5 or higher to fill out `POSTGRES_URL` 
5. Replace variables in `cogs/utils/var.py` with your own values
6. Create SQL tables using `sql/tables.sql` definitions with console or run `py main.py db create`
7. Run the bot with `py main.py` 
   * if you want to run test version of the bot then you need to create `tlist.py` file with 
   following template below and run the bot with an extra flag `py main.py --test` 
   
```python
"""
Just list of extensions from `./cogs` that are going to be tested with Testing version of the Bot 

-- List them without `.py`-ending as in 'confessions' and not 'confessions.py'

Actual AluBot does not use this file at all, the bot just assumes the `test_list` empty
"""
test_list = [  # for test bot
    'embedmaker',  # just some cogs to test 
    'fun', 
    'error',  # error handler from there is handy
    'help',  # so you can look how the command looks in `$help` command
]
```
### Thanks 
Thanks to everybody who has ever helped me with the bot in any way or form.
