### Current thoughts

0. dont forget to add unload_cog while editing for other stuff
1. routing thing for league
2. do a research on star thing *roles
3. request_matchmaking_stats()
4. add some difference between league and dota database add logs, icon i guess
5. edge cases when people delete channels/guilds
6. async sqlalchemy and idk research better code/approach - maybe subclass database classes ?
7. look at every cog in robo danny/pycord manager/stella
8. rewrite purge into something better
9. abandon not scored games for match history
10. DPC ranking command, Dpc points too
11. make muted by who into logs

### Fix Later
16. ?tag emoji escapes 
17. add image name for convert thing (check resolution too 112)
maybe make error original for conversion error as well rom converters


### New Features
18. nsfw functions

### Steal feature
20. My own starboard | CarlBot 
21. My own polls | Poolmaker Bot

### Future
22. twitch stream live proper listener when twitch releases it
18. add "all" key into heroes so all heroes can be traced

### IMPROVE
24. `map` usages
25. remove `regex` library in favour of `re`
27. remember `a[start:stop:step]` so `a[::-1]` is reverse
28. ?tag learn async
29. learn collection lib
30. ?tag eval
31. make a few server with emotes for more interesting #emotespam or maybe even code feature where bot make some guilds and populates them with emotes
32. research TypeVar stuff
33. remember if we ever have embed limit problems we can shorten emotes into `<:_:id> instead of <:name:id>` (need to check if it works)
