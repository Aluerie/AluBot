### TI pause time
1. embed builder
   * editor 
   * context menu usage 
   * find other embed makers
2. find other embed makers
9. make muted by who into logs
3. make /birthday set into view modals 
4. League patches find the pic that is patch summary
4. GitHub thing issues into fewer posts
5. Solve twitter somehow IDK fok ; Task for reload twitter I think
6. rewrite things from testing standpoint
7. rewrite daily reminders into something more sophisticated 
   * put texts into database
   * generalize code creation - probably ask in discordpy (I mean 6 task creators are same code)
8. start using asyncpg thing probably
9. count command usage
10. reaction roles with new selects I guess
11. 
20. think about this new Roles dropdown select menu
21. Probably think about better TFT errors notifs
22. move utils into `./cogs`
23. autocomplete for rules
24. rewrite timers i say (database loop.create_task which searches for the next closets timer)
25. skip beta for help command
26. 
### Current thoughts
1. routing thing for league
3. add some difference between league and dota database add logs, icon I guess
4. edge cases when people delete channels/guilds
5. async sqlalchemy and IDK research better code/approach - maybe subclass database classes ?
6. look at every cog in robo danny/pycord manager/stella
7. rewrite purge into something better
8. abandon not scored games for match history
11. context menu commands into help menu somehow IDK
12. clips twitch check 
13. slnt - rename to slant ;

### Later
1. custom server name for dotafeed feature
2. add league account check to league after we rewrite it a bit better
3. make blocked words league to be a command that takes/writes rules into dataabase
4. request_matchmaking_stats()

### Fix Later
1. ?tag emoji escapes 
2. add image name for convert thing (check resolution too 112)
maybe make error original for conversion error as well rom converters


### New Features
1. nsfw functions

### Steal feature
1. My own starboard | CarlBot 
2. My own polls | Poolmaker Bot

### Future
1. twitch stream live proper listener when twitch releases it
2. add "all" key into heroes so all heroes can be traced

### IMPROVE
1. `map` usages
2. remove `regex` library in favour of `re`
3. remember `a[start:stop:step]` so `a[::-1]` is reverse
4. ?tag learn async
5. learn collection lib
6. ?tag eval
7. make a few server with emotes for more interesting #emotespam or maybe even code feature where bot make some guilds and populates them with emotes
8. research TypeVar stuff
9. remember if we ever have embed limit problems we can shorten emotes into `<:_:id> instead of <:name:id>` (need to check if it works)
