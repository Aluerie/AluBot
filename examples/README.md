# Examples

This folder contains some code snippets useful for testing or quick copy-pasting, such as:

* `examples/beta/` folder which has a clean state for `exts/beta.py` file where I conduct various beta testings outside
    of messing with actual code of the bot. After a while `exts/beta.py` becomes filled with all sorts of testing
    trash code meaning I want to reset it back to the original state.
* `pagination.py` with an example of how to use `utils.pagination` module for quick copy-pasting. Note, that I don't do
    many explaining comments because this meant to be quickly copy-pasted rather than as an educational example.
* etc and more to come.
